# 🚗 Traffic Accident Hotspot Reporter

## Overview

Traffic Accident Hotspot Reporter is a fully offline Python application developed using Streamlit. It reads road accident records from a CSV file, performs data cleaning and validation, calculates key safety metrics, and presents the results through an interactive dashboard.

The application is designed to work with any replacement CSV file that follows the same data schema.

# Installation

Clone or download the project folder.

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

Windows:

```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/macOS:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Running the Project

## Step 1 – Generate Cleaned Data

Run:

```
python roadsense_data_cleaning_v1.py
```

This generates:

* roadsense_cleaned_records_v1.csv

---

## Step 2 – Generate Summary Metrics

Run:

```
python roadsense_kpi_engine_v1.py
```

This generates:

* roadsense_summary_metrics_v1.csv
* roadsense_hotspot_ranking_v1.csv

---

## Step 3 – Launch the Dashboard

Run:

```
streamlit run roadsense_dashboard_v1.py
```

The dashboard will open automatically in your default web browser.

---

# Running Unit Tests

Execute the following command:

```
pytest tests/test_roadsense_v1.py -v
```

Expected output:

```
7 passed
```

# Replacing the Input CSV

The application supports replacement datasets.

To use another dataset:

1. Replace the file inside the **assets** folder.
2. Keep the filename:

```
roadsense_accident_records_raw_v1.csv
```

Alternatively, update the file path in **config.py**.

The replacement dataset must contain the same column structure as the original dataset.

Required columns:

* accident_id
* accident_date
* hour_of_day
* location_name
* zone
* road_type
* severity
* weather_condition

Optional columns:

* latitude
* longitude
